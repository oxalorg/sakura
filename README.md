# [sakura](https://oxal.org/projects/sakura): a minimal ***classless*** css *framework* / **theme**.

[Go to [Github repository](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura)]

Just drop in `sakura.css` to any webpage and go from
ugly looking 1900's website to a pretty modern website
in literally 0 seconds.

Sakura supports extremely easy theming support using
variables for duotone color scheming.

Comes with several existing themes, can be found in the
`css` folder of this repository.
